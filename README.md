**Movie Dataset Analysis**
In this notebook, I explore a movie dataset to uncover factors that contribute to a movie's success. I focus on key elements like ratings, budgets, and gross earnings to understand what drives a movie's performance.

**Some of the key questions I address in this analysis include:**
1. Which production companies are the most profitable?
2. How strongly are a movie's budget and earnings related?
3. What factors drive both financial and critical success?

I start by performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean up any missing values in the dataset. After that, I visualize key metrics to get a better understanding of how the data is distributed and how different factors relate to each other. Finally, I conduct a correlation analysis to figure out which factors, such as budget, score, and genre, have the greatest impact on things like earnings and ratings. I also look at categorical fields like genres and production companies to assess their role in movie success.
